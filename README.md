# Phase1_Project
Phase one project 

As stated in the project outline, the business problem is: "Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create."

## My Solution

From the business problem, the most important aspect is the 'type of films', as highlighted above. I took the 'type of film' to mean the genre of the movies. We shall use the following data sets:

* "tn.movie_budgets1.csv"
* "title.basics.csv"
* "title.crew.csv"
*  "title.ratings.csv"

The plan is to find the correlations of the different genres to the profits, popularity, rating, directors, and writers. 

* Profits - Because we want to tell which genre averages the highest amount of Net 
 profit
* Popularity - Because we want to tell which genre is most watched 
* Rating - Because we want to tell which genre is most likable 
* Directors and Writers - Because we want to tell the directors and writers who are responsible for producing such great movies

The data is filled with noise and through diligent data analysis we shall carefully clean the data and use various analytical tools to derive the desired data.
